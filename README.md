The focus of this analysis exercise is to create a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard using Tableau to analyze global startup trends from 2000 to 2014. The data used is quite large and has high complexity, covering various aspects such as the number of startups, number of investors, total funding, startup status, as well as funding distribution by market category and funding type. Some of the problems faced in this project include:
1.	Large Data Volume: The dataset used is quite large, causing high memory consumption when processed in Tableau.
2.	Visualization Complexity: The data must be presented in an easy-to-understand format without sacrificing the details of the analysis.
3.	Data Processing: Data transformation is required before visualization to ensure accuracy and relevance of insights.
4.	Choosing the Right KPIs: Must determine the most relevant metrics to illustrate startup performance and investment.

Task
The objectives of this project are:
1.	Create an interactive dashboard that can provide deep insights into startup trends.
2.	Visualize data effectively to aid analysis and decision making.
3.	Identify investment patterns and startup performance by funding type, industry, and region.
4.	Optimize dashboard performance to remain responsive even when using large datasets.

Insight
From the results of the analysis, several insights were obtained, among others:
1.	Highest Funding by Startup: Clearwire secured the highest funding of $5.7 billion, followed by sigmacare, Facebook, Carestream, and Flipkart.
2.	Dominant Funding Type: Venture capital is the largest funding type with a total of $14.5 billion, indicating that investors are more likely to provide long-term funding for startups that have high growth potential.
3.	Highest Funded Industries: The Biotechnology industry had the highest funding of $41.4 billion, followed by Software and Clean Technology.
4.	Most Startups Are Still Operating: Out of a total of 34,823 startups, about 85.5% are still in operation, while the rest have been acquired or closed.
5.	Investor Distribution: Investors come from different regions with varying investment amounts, showing that startups have a global appeal to financiers.

Advice
This project can still be further developed with several machine learning-based approaches, such as:
1.	Startup Sustainability Prediction: Using machine learning models to predict the likelihood of success or failure of a startup based on funding patterns, industry, and other factors.
2.	Investor Segmentation: Using clustering to categorize investors based on investment patterns and sector preferences.
3.	Funding Recommendation: Develop a recommendation system to help startups find the most suitable investors based on historical data.
4.	Limitations of Historical Data: Since the data used is only up to 2014, there are limitations in analyzing recent trends and forecasting for the future. Therefore, this dashboard is more suitable for data analysis training than for real-time business decision making.
5.	Dataset Update: If it is to be used for more accurate and real-time analysis, it is necessary to update the dataset with the latest data to reflect the latest investment trends and startup developments.
With further development, this project can provide deeper insights and become a strategic tool for investors and startups in making business decisions.
